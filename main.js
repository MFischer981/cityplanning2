var textArray = ["Our city strives to make healthcare a major priority. We believe each citizen should have access to affordable healthcare regardless of their economic status. The health of citizens is crucial to maintaining a lively community. In order to achieve this and cut down on traffic at the same time, we charge a 40% carbon tax on traditional vehicles, and a 20% tax on hybrid vehicles. This tax goes towards funding affordable healthcare for all. Affordable healthcare for all allows the city to pay for up to 90% of medical cost depending on a family's ability to pay themselves. <br><br>We have 2 state of the art hospitals as well as 8 clinics across town. Each of our medical facilities are placed carefully in different neighbors in order to make it easily accessible for all of our citizens. Carefully spreading out medical facilities across neighborhoods of different socioeconomic classes helps prevents health disparities. Healthcare should be equally accessible to people of all different social classes. <br><br>In order to keep people healthy and out of hospitals and clinics in the first place we have built a city that promotes healthy living. We prioritize the construction and approval of healthy restaurants. We also have 3 different large parks around the community. All of our roads have wide bike lanes. Our heavy carbon tax keeps the air pollution very low. Our family and recreational facilities provide healthy activities for families of all different ages. Our city has strict regulations of employers that prevent employees from being forced to work long hours.",
    "Education is the future of any well grounded society, so we promote it by offering a free 15 year education for all citizens, grades K-12 and some college. All education is free if you qualify and depending on your test scores. Education is financed through our carbon tax and public transportation revenue. Our education system puts a heavy emphasis on encouraging students to take on rigorous STEM courses. We also employ industry professionals to help us design curriculum that will help students prepare for real world careers. This helps us prepare students for a future with hands on work experience while they are still in school. We hope by focusing on technology and environmentally focused classes we can prepare students to contribute to a better future for our community. <br><br>Housing over 150,000 citizens on our small peninsula is a daunting task. Our population relies on high density residential areas to make the most of our small peninsula. It’s not only effective but it is also beneficial for fostering tightly knit communities and promoting the education and the arts. Outside of the main peninsula, we also offer homes for those who prefer a more space in a suburban single family home. <br><br>Clean food is a high priority for any large conglomeration of people. We strive to ensure the highest standard of quality in our agricultural goods. To make the most out of our limited amount of land we have constructed greenhouses on the roofs of our commercial buildings. We focus on staple crops that can provide the most nutrients for our citizens to maximize a healthy living. We hope to be totally self-sustainable within 10 years time.",
    "Pollution should be the main focus of any competent civil engineer head when planning to build a sustainable and lasting city. Our small California town is thinking about the importance of planning for the future. We have carefully constructed our utility infrastructure to prevent pollution. Our town relies completely on green energy from multiple sources. Because our town is located on the California coast we have access to sunshine all year long making solar one our main sources of energy. Our coastline wraps around a small cover which empties over a natural waterfall. This waterfall produces a huge amount of hydroelectricity. Within the hills outside of the cove we have constructed a large wind farm that produces 25% of our towns green energy each year. To prevent pollution in our water we have a carefully constructed water treatment plant just outside of the city. The water is filtered and can be reintroduced back into the environment through our tap water. The water undergoes a rigorous filtration process in order to prevent any waste from being introduced into the environment. Our treatment plant is inspected annually and tested monthly to make sure we are doing all we can to maintain best practice and provide clean water for our citizens. <br><br>We have designed strict regulations to prevent manufacturers from dumping pollution into the ocean, air, or surrounding land. Every company that wishes to manufacture from our industrial zone must produce goods that are completely environmentally friendly. This means that the goods must be ecologically friendly and may not damage the environment and their waste products can be reused and repurposed. By doing this we are able to control and minimize waste in our community. As time goes on we hope to minimize waste to 0% and produce only 100% recyclable goods. <br><br>We are proud to have put into place an incentive program for reducing waste. Each month citizen receive a bill for their trash pickup. However when citizens drop off recycling at our recycling plant we provide citizen with up to 75% off on their trash pickup bill. This can provide citizens with up to $720 each year in savings. <br><br>Each month our city holds a Green City Council meeting to review our practices and ensure we are doing the best thing for our citizens and the environment. This helps us maintain best practice when it comes to protecting the ecosystem. Our town employs top environmental scientists to help our politicians make the best choices possible. <br><br>In order to preserve the beauty of the California peninsula we have preserved many large plots of land. We have also constructed over 3 sqmi of parks. This is designed to ensure that the beauty of the land is preserved for many generations to come.",
    "Transportation in our city is provided by our above ground monorail system which can reach up to 60 mph for a quick and convenient trip to your next stop. Our rail system provides citizen with low cost and environmentally friendly transportation. This system alleviates the carbon tax from impacting environmentally conscious citizens. Our comprehensive monorail network extends throughout the city and reaches out into all of our outlying centers allowing citizens inside and outside of the city center to travel wherever they need. <br><br>In an attempt to reduce and minimize the impact of shipping and hauling trucks we have instead opted for a shipping rail designed to allow local industries and businesses to opt for a environmentally friendly option when moving freight. Goods exported outside of county limits will not face a carbon tax. <br><br>Citizens who choose to continue to drive despite the carbon tax will pay an additional fee on their fuel cost. Our municipality charges a 40% carbon tax on traditional vehicles, and a 20% tax on hybrid vehicles. This system helps cut down on the traffic and pollution caused by personal transportation. Carpooling will be rewarded by access to carpool lanes as well as a 10% carbon tax discount. <br><br>Our town provides some of the safest and quickest bike lanes in the country. Our bike lanes are very wide in order to accommodate multidirectional traffic. These bike lanes follow the same traffic laws that apply to traditional traffic. For citizens who do not have the space or money to pay for a bike we provide free bike rentals. With our newly implemented bike lane system we have reduced traffic by 23% and 1 in every 6 people now consistently ride a bike. Our bike lane system is constantly expanding and replacing traditional roadways across the city. <br><br>We also provide extensive pedestrian walkways to allow citizens and tourist to travel around the city quickly and easily. The corner of every block provides a directory to allow tourist to easily find restaurants and attractions. Our walkway is lined with emergency call stations in order to fight crime and make our city sidewalks safe for everyone. 89% of parents of elementary school students say that they feel safe with their student walking to school within our city. <br><br>Tourists can take rowboats and sailboats out on the public waterways. Any form of motorized watercraft is not permissible with the cove or along our coastline.This prevents any pollution from contaminating our coastline and our beautiful cove. <br><br>",
    "Being on prime California Coastal real estate forces us to make a conscious effort to prevent soil erosion of the cliffs that run parallel to the ocean. In order to combat soil erosion we have planted trees with deep roots along the cliffside in order to stop the soil from breaking apart. We have also planted ornamental grass to protect the soil beneath and combat erosion. Terraces have been placed along the coastline. These provide lookouts for tourists but also help create retaining walls to prevent the soil from eroding any further. <br><br>Water is transported throughout the city via underground pipes. These pipes are carefully engineer to reduce their ecological impact. There are no pipes beneath any protected lands. Our drainage pipes lead directly to our water reclamation center in order to prevent trash or waste from being swept into the ocean. Water waste is from residential and commercial properties is also sent to our water reclamation point. On plant follows a 24 point system, which includes guidelines that are much stricter than the ones provided by the EPA. This system prevents 99.8% of waste from reaching our oceans. This prevention rate has increased steadily over the past 20 years. By the year 2024 we expect the prevention rate to reach 100%. We have officers who patrol the waters 24/7 to prevent any dumping into the oceans. <br><br>Building a functional yet ecologically friendly electrical grid can be extremely difficult. However we have carefully crafted an electric grid that minimizes the impact on the environment. Our city is powered by %100 clean energy. Our energy grid is powered by a wind farm, solar panel plant, and a hydroelectric dam. This renewable energy prevents much of the ecological impacts of traditional energy resources. Our green city council is constantly looking for new energy sources. <br><br>Our investment in green energy also helps reduce electric prices throughout the city. Although building our infrastructure has taken some time our town treasurer and lead engineer have predicted that the investment will save the city and taxpayers an estimated 2.4 billion dollars over the next 10 years. The newly constructed energy sources also have created an influx of jobs which have helped stimulate and growing economy. <br><br>Our monorail network and bike lane system transports over 78% of our citizens. Another 12% of citizens walk as their sole mean of transportation. This means that only 10% of residents use the road. Our monorail network has a 99.998% uptime and functions 24/7 allowing citizens to get anywhere at anytime. Our sidewalk, bikelane, and road networks are laid out in a simple grid to make getting around as easy as possible. City services are placed conveniently across the city making public access to services easier than ever.",
    "We are home to the largest green energy company in the world called Greenlight Energy and Manufacturing. Greenlight is based out of our city and drives over $20 billion dollars in revenue to our country each year. These additional funds help keep our town healthy and thriving. Our town also relies on its manufactured goods to help keep our city running on green energy. Allowing large businesses to manufacture in our community not only is a great source of income for our community but it also provides many jobs for our citizens. <br><br>  Our green city council has also partnered with Greenlight to research and develop new products and solutions to major environmental problems. Making investments in companies that are looking to the future is a key part of running a successful and thriving community. The solutions we find for our community can be used and adapted to help other communities solve their environmental problems. <br><br>We also provide manufacturing space to several different construction companies. We have several contracts with these companies that allow us to receive massive discounts. These discounts help save our citizens tax dollars. They also allow us to constantly improve our infrastructure in order to build a strong and thriving community. <br><br>Our community relies on five essential crops to feed the citizens. These crops include potatoes, corn, squash, beans, and kale. These crops are an integral part of providing our citizens with the necessary nutrients they need and crave. These crops are extremely hardy and can resist the harsh conditions of coastal California. Due to the nutrient-rich soil found along the California coast, our crops are full of nutrients that help keep our citizens healthy. <br><br>We encourage healthy eating in our community by promoting and advertising healthy eating options throughout our community. Our community and family centers provide opportunities for families to learn about healthy eating in the community. Outside our town square is a community garden that is over a quarter mile wide. This garden is  completely managed by children from the local elementary schools. This process helps teach the leaders of the future the science behind raising crops. <br><br>All of our speciality (non-chain) restaurants, and grocery stores use locally grown produce. Using locally grown produce helps create more jobs for community members. This also helps promote healthy eating and supports local farmers. The money spent on local crops goes directly back into the county’s economy. <br><br>Most importantly growing food locally helps reduce the amount of miles the food has to travel to get to its destination. This in turn reduces our dependence on fossil fuels which reduces air pollution and cuts down on the amount of greenhouse gases released into the environment. This also promotes accountability among farmers and business owners. When food is raised and grown locally the consumer has a better understanding of where their food is being produced."
